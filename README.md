## What I used & learned

The nested routing in REMIX made it extremely easy to set major UI elements that I wanted present throughout the site. By segmenting the URL the framework maps a hierarchy of route components that can be known before rendering. This does a few things: 

- Shared layouts for each route
- Routes are only concerned with data on specific page
-  Decreases load time for static content 

This project was also my first time using a mySQL database as a back-end to hold the posts for the blog. The posts are stored in markdown and pulled from the database and formatted for the front-end. With Prisma I was able to set up a single SCHEMA to pull data from the mySQL database. 

This project gave me lots of practice pulling data from an outside source and formatting it on the front-end. It also gave me a great look at the benefits of using a framework like REMIX and encouraged me to try out other frameworks!
